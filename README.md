# Streamlit Demo: QR codes detection demo

This project demonstrates the QR codes detection model, based on [Ultralytics YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5), trained on custom [QR-Codes dataset](https://github.com/kolabit/qr-codes), and implemented as an interactive [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) app.
