# Streamlit Demo: QR codes detection demo

This project demonstrates the QR codes detection model, based on [Ultralytics YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5), trained on custom [QR-Codes dataset](https://github.com/kolabit/qr-codes), and implemented as an interactive [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) app.
Demo is based on [Udacity self-driving-car demo](https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/demo-self-driving)

# Run demo:
Open the [Streamlit QR codes detection demo page](https://kolabit-qr-codes-detection-demo-streamlit-app-wuj4pl.streamlit.app)
